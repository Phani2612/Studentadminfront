# Studentadminfront


Developed a full-stack CRUD application using the MERN stack to manage student administration tasks. The application allows users to perform create, read, update, and delete operations on student records, providing a comprehensive solution for student management.

Technologies Used: Utilized the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to develop the frontend and backend of the application. Integrated MongoDB Atlas for seamless data storage, enabling efficient management of student records.

Achievements or Impact: Successfully deployed the application on both AWS and Render platforms, ensuring optimal accessibility and performance for users. The application's features, including CRUD operations and MongoDB integration, provide users with a robust platform for managing student information. GitHub repositories for the frontend and backend facilitate collaboration and version control, enhancing project development and maintenance.
